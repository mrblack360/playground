## Bash Playground

This is a playground for unstructured bash scripts

### `file_processor`

This is a script which is used to extract MSISDN and IP address from HLR log files

#### How to use

- Extract the HLR logs files and place them in the files directory
- Make sure that the path `./exports/` exists
- Then start the script by running `sh file_processor.sh >> log_file` _(You can replace the `log_file` with the actual log file path)_
